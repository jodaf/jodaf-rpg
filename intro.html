<p>
Welcome to my DND pages!  I've been playing the game since 1979, when I first
read about it in <i>Games</i> magazine.  My current crew and I started playing
back in 1981, which means we're well past our silver anniversary, on our way
to gold.
</p><p>
Back when I had much, much more spare time than I do now, I designed a campaign
world named Estbal (okay, it's a silly name, but no worse than "Oerth"),
similar in character to Greyhawk, that has been the scene of all my campaigns
since.  A few years I ago I started thinking about what it would be like if,
instead of operating in a place where adventurers were an accepted part of
society, characters had to contend with a society that was hostile to their
very presence.  I designed the Bradona Tursh campaign setting, where characters
are part of an underground operating against a Taliban-inspired, magic-hating
government.  Background information and several campaign modules, most of which
could easily be adapted to other settings, are available on-line.  One of my
players, Rich Hakesley, has recently been trading off DM duties with me.  He
fleshed out a region of Bradona Tursh named Recton Drury into a
<a href='https://www.jodaf.com/rich' target='top'>related campaign
setting</a> reminiscent of the Scottish highlands resistance to British rule
during the Jacobite years.  Background information is available on-line.
</p><p>
Over the past 25 years I've written quite a few campaigns, and I have an
ongoing, slow-moving project to convert them into HTML.  Several of these, in
varying stages of completion, are available and could be converted to
third-edition play with a small amount of effort.  If you're curious about
exactly what my group has been through over the past quarter century, I've also
compiled a module history for my group.
</p><p>
Soon after I started playing DND, I began working on software to automate the
generation of character sheets.  The program has been through several
incarnations, including versions written in a now-defunct language named PPL,
Cobol (yes, Cobol), and Snobol.  My latest effort is a web-based JavaScript
program called Quilvyn.  You can
<a href='https://www.jodaf.com/quilvyn/core/quilvyndoc.html' target='top'>view the Quilvyn
documentation</a>,
<a href='https://www.jodaf.com/quilvyn/quilvyn.html' target='top'>run the program</a>,
or <a href='https://github.com/jodaf' target='top'>download the
sources</a> via your browser.

I welcome feedback on these pages.
